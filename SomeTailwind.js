```javascript
// SomeTailwind.js
import { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components';

const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`
  body {
    @apply font-sans text-gray-900 antialiased;
  }
`;

export default GlobalStyle;
```
This code attempts to use Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a styled-components template literal.  This will not work directly because styled-components processes the CSS separately from how Tailwind works.  The `@apply` directive relies on Tailwind's post-processing step which doesn't happen in this context. 

The error you might see in your browser console will depend on styled-components and your browser, but the root cause is the mismatch between how Tailwind and styled-components handle CSS.

Another uncommon error occurs when trying to use Tailwind directives in a JSX expression, resulting in an error or unexpected behavior.
```jsx
<div className={`bg-${someVariable}`}/>
```
If `someVariable` isn't correctly evaluated to a valid Tailwind class, it may not render correctly or may throw an error.
